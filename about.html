		<h1>Your internet liberty is at risk</h1>
		<p>Everytime you go online you are protected, no one should mess with what you see, you dont expect you internet provider to do such things. Thats because you are protected by Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality is the basic principle that prohibits internet service providers like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon from speeding up, slowing down or blocking any content, applications or websites you want to use. Net Neutrality is the way that the internet has always worked [<a href="https://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now"> https://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now</a>].</p>

		<p>Activist pressured the Federal Communications Commision to Net Neutrality rules. Allowing you to share information with out any interferance.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="inf2">
		<h3>What if we lose Net Neutrality?</h3>
		<p>Net Neutrality = Free Speech</p>
		<p>If we lose this battle, the internet will never be the internet again. The internet is a open place, imagine a world were cable companies could decide how much internet you get and what websites you visit. Liberty will be avolished.</p>
